Create a bot for personal and/or commercial use in the Highrise game.
If you're going to create a bot on Highrise in the "traditional" way, you might run into some problems. To avoid this, I've made it easier and made available the code that, with the help of the game itself and Pocket Worlds, enabled my bot to connect to my room in the game.
In addition, you can create customized commands that are made available by Highrise and Pocket Worlds. It's also possible to change where the bot is in the room, moving it from one place to another just by using commands.
The bot doesn't require so many details in the code and, for this reason, Pocket Worlds, the company that founded Highrise, not only recommends that the bot be created in Python, but also, with a few steps, without going too far into the teaching, on its own website, helps you to create the bot in the same programming language (Python).
If you're a Highrise player, you don't necessarily need to create a bot. It's more useful for people who earn gold (in-game currency) from other people.

Highrise is a game that aims to simulate the metaverse, or rather the digital world. It allows you to explore fashion and create your own avatar with all kinds of colors, clothes and accessories that are completely personalized.

The game allows you to make internal and external transactions to obtain clothes, accessories and even items to add to your own room. You can create hotels, squares and other places).
