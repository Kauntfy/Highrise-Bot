Create a bot for personal and/or commercial use in the Highrise game.
If you're going to create a bot on Highrise in the "traditional" way, you might run into some problems. To avoid this, I've made it easier and made available the code that, with the help of the game itself and Pocket Worlds, enabled my bot to connect to my room in the game.
In addition, you can create customized commands that are made available by Highrise and Pocket Worlds. It's also possible to change where the bot is in the room, moving it from one place to another just by using commands.
If you're a Highrise player, you don't necessarily need to create a bot. It's more useful for people who earn gold (in-game currency) from other people.

Highrise is a game that aims to simulate the metaverse, or rather the digital world. It allows you to explore fashion and create your own avatar with all kinds of colors, clothes and accessories that are completely personalized.
When you join the game, you automatically join a community of over 50 million totally real players in a new world with endless possibilities. In addition, the game currently features 3D worlds, which are frequently optimized to run as smoothly as possible on your device.
